# ELECTRUM Fingerprint Validation (WIP)

Welcome to the repository for the validation and evaluation of the **ELECTRUM Fingerprint**! This repository is a **work-in-progress** (WIP) and currently hosts the code and datasets used to test and assess the performance of the ELECTRUM fingerprint. Find the ELECTRUM preprint [here](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-vqktn).

## About This Repo

This repository is primarily aimed at providing a platform to **evaluate and test the ELECTRUM fingerprint**. A more polished and finalized version of the fingerprint, along with additional features, will be released in a separate repository in the near future.

Please note that the code and data here are still being refined, and as such, you may encounter incomplete features or areas that require optimization.

## Contributions and Feedback

We are **actively looking for suggestions and feedback** to help us improve this approach. Whether it's about the overall methodology, specific code improvements, or new ideas on how to enhance the fingerprint, we are very open to your input.

We strive to stay active on **pull requests** and aim to create a collaborative environment. So, if you have suggestions, feel free to submit a PR, and we will get back to you as soon as possible.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any bugs or issues, or if something isn't working as expected, please let us know by opening an issue on this repository. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us improve the project!
